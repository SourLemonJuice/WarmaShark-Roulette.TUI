## Documents

The README don't have any useful information, so...

Some incomplete documents here: [docs/](docs/)\
But it's also just for myself...

## Build system

Goto `source/` folder and run `make` or `make default` or `make warmaShark.out`\
Executable file named `warmaShark.out`

## Todo list

- Not in readme, sorry. I didn't write them anywhere.

If those code can help you, I will also be happy.
